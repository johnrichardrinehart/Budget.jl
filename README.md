Budget.jl
=========

The `julia` community has built a fantastic plotting library,
[Plots.jl](http://docs.juliaplots.org/), that I love to use with
[Plotly](https://plotly.com/) to generate beautiful, interactive charts. This
package facilitates the forecasting of investment portfolios by defining and
exposing a couple of useful types and a single method, `portfolio_timeline`.


An example of using this package can be found in
[`/examples/plot.jl`](https://github.com/johnrichardrinehart/Budget.jl/tree/main/examples/plot.jl).
